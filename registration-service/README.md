# Token Factory Registration Service
Tenant and user registration

## Background
Token Factory Registration Service is the first attempt to build a GraphQL Server backend using Apollo specifically for the Token Factory Login Service.   (https://www.apollographql.com/server).    The application is a simple user registry application. The application supports creation of tenants, users, login and also an API to find out details about the currently authenticated user.

## Prerequisites
Token Factory does have a dependency on MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) for local testing and dev.   For automated builds in Travis, the .travis.yml leverages the built in mongodb service.  For Kubernetes deployments to IBM Cloud we deploy a mongodb helm chart.
```
*Start MongoDB*
./bin/mongod -dbpath deleteme/
```

### Start server
To run this program, NPM install the various dependencies and start the server.  The server requires a JWT (JSON Web Token) secret to start so just randomly generate one for testing.  

```
npm install; npm run build; npm run start:development
```

### Testing
```
npm install; make build-app
npm run test
```
